## About Final Project

The final project for this course was a digital recruitment system for a company. The system was built using PHP, MySQL, JQuery, AJAX and Javascript. This repo has that project as [submodule](/EzRecruit/). I have planned to work on this project in the future and make it a full-fledged recruitment system even after the end of the course.

The main/upstream repo for the final project is [here](https://github.com/Abir-Tx/EzRecruit)

> Note: As this repo will be archived after the end of the course, the submodule won't be updated. So, the submodule will be pointing to the last commit of the project (Specifically, the commit will point to the last commit when project defense took place) and will not be updated. So if you want to see the latest changes, you can visit or keep track of the upstream repo.
